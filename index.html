                Graphic Designer at a print shop in Brooklyn, NY named SaveMor Digital Printing. Under my brilliant Sr. Designer there, I learned about typography, client management, brand guidelines, and print design. Over the last four years, I have worked full-time and freelance graphic design roles, with six months of my work unique to focusing on UX design.
